# Student Life Tours Website
## Description
The project is a website that advertises the Student Life tours that take place at NYUAD. Users are able to "sign up" for tours and see a sample tour of the convinience store in the website.
## Process
* Filming the video
	* We filmed the video in under 1 hour and on a mobile phone which resulted in a low quality video.
* Sketched out possible wireframes
	* <img src="https://i.ibb.co/HVJnHRQ/image0.jpg" height="500" />
* Selected a design.
	* I personally selected a similar design to the above wireframe (just for the header part) however with the added feature of users being able to sign up for a tour in order to add some interactivity to the site.
* Selected colors and fonts
	* I wanted the website to have a serious but cool tone and resemble the nyu brand
	* The colors were inspired by the NYU guidelines on their site

		* The header was NYU's main color
		* The error and success messages in the sign up for a tour form was the accent colors in the nyu guidelines
		* The button and quote border color were from the green complement accent color in the nyu guidelines
	* The font I selected was "Playfair Display" after looking at a myriad of them on Google Fonts
* Started making the simple structure of the site in html and css
	* Navigation bar with NYUAD logo and nav items
	* Content body for two col header
	* Content body for quote
	* Content body for team
* Added the video onto the directory and embedded it using the Video tag
* Created the sign up for tour form in html & css
* Created the sign up for tour form logic in javascript with animiations etc.
	* The animation for the form loading was fun to make as I used the NYU torch image from student portal and made it rotate
* Added the quote css code and added a nice background image to it
* Added the code for the team section with hover to see fb account
* Added bios for each team member
* Commented and organized all the html, css and js so that it is easy to understand.

## Reflection / Evaluation
The fact that I would not be able to use Bootstrap or Jquery was a bit daunting as I realized just how reliant I am on them. Through this project I was forced to re-learn css and javascript and this has helped me to further understand how stuff in the frontend works. It was definetely harder to code certain parts of the site especially the form as using vanilla javascript made it a pain. Also certain styles such as the height of each nav item in the nav bar was hard to get right.
To improve the user experience of the site I believe responsiveness among devices is something that needs to be worked on.
