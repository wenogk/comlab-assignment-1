## Reflection / Evaluation
The fact that I would not be able to use Bootstrap or Jquery was a bit daunting as I realized just how reliant I am on them. Through this project I was forced to re-learn css and javascript and this has helped me to further understand how stuff in the frontend works. It was definetely harder to code certain parts of the site especially the form as using vanilla javascript made it a pain. Also certain styles such as the height of each nav item in the nav bar was hard to get right.
